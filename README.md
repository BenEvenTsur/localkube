[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/redspread/localkube.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/redspread/localkube)

`localkube` provides a Kubernetes cluster configured to run locally and optimized for rapid development. 

The environment is intended to be used with Kubernetes development tool [spread](https://github.com/redspread/spread). It is similar to [monokube](https://github.com/polvi/monokube).
